## Portfolio Assignment
For this portfolio assignment, I decided to demostrate push/replace use cases with my unique projects Links. I also decided to use a SectionList for my skills page to get some practice with mapping out object data which turned out really nicely for me. Other than that, everything was pretty straight forward and good practice using expo-router.

## Image Picker
For the second part of this assignment, I implemented an image picker for the home page profile picture. Here, users can start by allowing the app access to their photos and then choose one to be used as the profile picture. Here is a demonstration of the feature:
