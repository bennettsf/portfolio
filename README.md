## Portfolio Assignment
For this portfolio assignment, I decided to demostrate push/replace use cases with my unique projects Links. I also decided to use a SectionList for my skills page to get some practice with mapping out object data which turned out really nicely for me. Other than that, everything was pretty straight forward and good practice using expo-router.
